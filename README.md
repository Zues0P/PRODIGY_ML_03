Cat vs Dog Classifier
This project implements a cat vs dog image classifier using SVM with HOG features. The classifier is trained on a dataset of cat and dog images to distinguish between the two.

Process
1. Data Collection: Gathered a dataset of cat and dog images from various sources.
2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocessed the images by resizing them to 64x64 pixels, converting them to grayscale, and extracting HOG features.
3. Model Training: Trained an SVM classifier using the preprocessed images and HOG features.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the trained model using a validation set and calculated the accuracy.
5. Making Predictions: Used the trained model to make predictions on test images.
6. Results: Achieved an accuracy of 70% on the validation set and submitted the predictions for the test set to obtain the final accuracy.

Usage
Clone the repository.
Download the dataset and organize it into train and test1 folders.
Install the required dependencies.
Follow the steps in the code to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.
